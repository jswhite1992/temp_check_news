# temp_check_news

The goal of this project is to create a news site that combats disinformation in the name of speed to publish.
Articles can only be publish from the /home page.
The "/" page is what the readers see.
The "/home" page is where you can edit, delete, and submit articles.
Articles have 3 stages:
Hot - Freshly posted and will only show a headline & a summary.
Cold - 24 hours after article is posted and will show the entire article, allowing time for the publisher to get the facts right.

Future goals include:
1. Make the website more readeable and user friendly
2. Make the article submission screen more journalist friendly
3. Make the readeres home page more interesting
4. Add more features such as "number of times article has been edited", sharing links, etc
5. Add sections and categories to articles "may require a database deletion".
6. Make articles searchable
7. Add trending section to home page
8. Go wild with features!!
